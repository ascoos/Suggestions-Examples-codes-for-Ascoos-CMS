# 3LT Templates
ASCOOS CMS templates are a powerful tool to configure your page to look the way you want.

The function of templates in ASCOOS CMS is truly unique because it is based on a three-level template interaction system (Front, Frontpage and EFP), thus making the management and adaptability of your page unique.

The ability to embed blocks, programs, widgets, or other display layers in these three layers helps you customize individual parts of your page without having to create new templates for every change you want to make to different parts of your web page .
